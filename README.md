<h1>Incident Handling: Creating Journal Entries</h1>

<b>An incident handler journal is a critical documentation tool used to record all the details about a cyber security incident and how that incident was dealt with. The journal keeps track of what happened, what actions were taken, and any important information related to the incident. These journal entries work better in a business setting to help teams stay organized during incident responses but I find it useful from time to time at my house.</b>

<h2>Incident Handling Scenario</h2>

<b>Review the following scenario. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.</b>
A small U.S. health care clini specializing in delibering primary-care services experiencedd a security incident on a Tuesday morning at approximately 9:00 AM. Serveral employees were unable to access the  files and software needded to do their job.

Addditionally, employees also reported that a ransom note was displayed on their computers. The ransom note statedd that all the company's files were encrypted by an organized group of unethical hackers who are known to target organizations in healthcare and trransportation industries. In exchange for restoring access to the encrypted files, the ransom note demanded a large sum of money in exchange for the decryption key.

The attackers were able to gain access into the company's network by using targeted phishing emails, which were sent to several employees of the company. The phishing emails contained a malicious attachment that installed malware on the employee's computer once it was downloaded.

Once the attackers gained access, they deployed their ransomware, which encrypted critical files. The company was unable to access critical patient data, causing major disruptions in their business operations. The company was forced to shut down their computer systems andd contact several organizations to reeport the incident and receive technical assistance.

<h2>Incident Handler's Journal Entry</h2>

<b>The document below is my crack at recording my own journal entries based on a variety of scenarios. I recorded the details of a ransomware attack and the investigation of a suspicious file hash. The document ends with a few questions about the overall feel of the project and what I enjoyed.</b>
